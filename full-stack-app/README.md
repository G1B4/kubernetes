This app was splitted for better understanding and It's based on th following article: https://www.callicoder.com/deploy-spring-mysql-react-nginx-kubernetes-persistent-volume-secret/ 

Original repo for this app is: https://github.com/callicoder/spring-security-react-ant-design-polls-app 

We already have a nfs-provisiong configured, so we are going to use it for MySQL.
